# Practice14 – Design Patterns in C++

This project contains two separate C++ programs that demonstrate the use of the Strategy and Decorator design patterns.

## Strategy Pattern – Text Filter

Located in `strategy/`.

This program prompts the user to enter a sentence, then lets them apply different text filters using the Strategy pattern. The filters include:

- Reverse
- Uppercase
- Remove vowels
- Censor bad words (case-insensitive)

The user can reapply filters without restarting the program. The profanity list was generated by AI and is included only to meet the assignment requirements. It doesn't reflect the beliefs or values of the author.

## Decorator Pattern – Purchase Calculator

Located in `decorator/`.

This program starts with a base purchase cost and allows the user to apply decorators to modify the final price:

- `TaxDecorator` – adds 10% tax
- `ShippingFeeDecorator` – adds a flat $5 fee
- `DiscountDecorator` – subtracts a user-defined percentage

The decorators are composed at runtime and applied in the order chosen by the user.
